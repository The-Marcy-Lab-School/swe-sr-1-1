## Question 1

Open the [Marcy Lab School Docs Style Guide](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/cheatsheets/style-guide) and read the section on Blocks, Comments, and White Spaces.

Then, share:
1. one rule that you found interesting (include the example)
2. one rule that you found confusing (include the example)
3. and a question you have about the style guide

We've provided a stencil for you to write your response. Notice the use of the triple-backtick to create a JavaScript code block.

### Response 1

Interesting Rule: ...

```js
// put the example here
```

Confusing Rule: ...

## Question 3

Why is it an industry practice to use automated tests like Jest tests when we can also test our code manually using `console.log` statements?

## Question 4

Read this article on [semantic versioning](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semantic-versioning)

What is Semantic Versioning, and what are the 3 main parts? If our application is in version 1.6.4, and we're releasing a "minor" feature, what would our new version number be?

### Response 4

## Question 5

Imagine you are teaching a brand new programmer a brief lesson about functions. Your lesson should have the following components:
* An explanation of the concept with an analogy ("In JavaScript, a function is like a ...")
* An example of the syntax for an arrow function using a JavaScript code block (triple back ticks)
* An explanation of the syntax using the terms **arrow function**, **parameter**, **code block**, and **return statement**

Below, we've provided an outline for your response but feel free to modify it as you see fit.

### Response 5
