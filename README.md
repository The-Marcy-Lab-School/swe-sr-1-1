# tc-sr-1-1

This is a Technical Curriculum (TC) Short Response (SR) assignment! In this assignment, you will be tasked with doing a little bit of research and then explaining your findings **in your own words**. 

Your intended audience should be someone with some experience programming but who is still learning. As such, strive to be as clear and concise as possible. There is a fine balance between too much information and just enough. Examples and analogies can often help!

## Assignment Setup

Upon receiving this assignment, you should do the following setup steps:
1. Clone down your repository using the provided GitHub classroom link. It should be unique to you.
2. `cd` into your repository.
3. Create and checkout a new branch called `draft`

    ```sh
    git checkout -b draft
    ```

Once you are inside of your `draft` branch, answer the questions found in the `short-responses` directory. Each question will be in a file called `qX.md` and you should add your answer under the `# Answer` heading using Markdown ([read about Markdown syntax here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)).

## Submitting the Assignment

To submit this assignment, do the following:
1. Add, commit, and push your `draft` branch to your repository. You made need to set an upstream branch.
2. Create a pull request and tag your instructor as a **Reviewer**.
3. Your instructor will provide feedback on GitHub and will either approve your branch to be merged or will request that you resubmit.

Please refer to the [Git Branching & PRs lesson](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/mod-0-command-line-interfaces-git-and-github/4-git-branching) in the Marcy Lab School Docs for guidance on creating branches and pull requests.

## Feedback

To support you in your growth as a technical communicator, your instructor will provide feedback on the following areas:

* **Clarity**: The communication is precise, concise, and unambiguous. Technical jargon is explained, and terms are used consistently.
* **Completeness**: The communication covers all necessary technical details, scenarios, and edge cases, providing sufficient examples or references.
* **Structure and Organization**: For longer answers, answers are logically organized with clear sections, headings, and transitions between ideas. The structure enhances understanding.
* **Use of Examples and Diagrams**: Uses well-chosen examples, diagrams, or code snippets (when appropriate) that significantly aid understanding and clarify complex concepts.
* **Accuracy**: The content is technically correct and adheres to current best practices and standards.
* **Conciseness**: The communication is efficient, avoiding unnecessary detail or excessive language, while still being comprehensive.

## AI
You may use generative AI tools like ChatGPT to help structure and refine your responses and to check for spelling and grammar mistakes. However, the majority of the writing should be yours! As a rule, aim to have no more than about 25% of the content written by a generative AI assistant.
