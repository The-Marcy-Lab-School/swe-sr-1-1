Welcome to your first short response assignment! While coding is the primary skill required of a programmer, we believe that technical communication is what distinguishes good programmers from great programmers. So, treat these assignments seriously! Write your responses as if you were planning on publishing them in a blog for the world to see.

For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Question 1

Open the [Marcy Lab School Docs Style Guide](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/cheatsheets/style-guide) and read the section on Blocks, Comments, and White Spaces.

Then, share:
1. one rule that you found interesting (include both the text of the rule and a code example)
2. one rule that you found confusing (include both the text of the rule and a code example)
3. and a question you have about the style guide

We've provided a stencil for you to write your response. Notice the use of the triple-backtick to create a JavaScript code block.

### Response 1

Interesting Rule: ...

```js
// put the example here
```

Confusing Rule: ...

```js
// put the example here
```

Question: ...

## Question 2

Modules let us split up our code into separate files. Explain one or more benefits of using modules as well as one or more downsides.

In your response, do not simply list the benefits/downsides. Explain _how_ modules provide that benefit to us.

### Response 2

## Question 3

Explain the pros and cons of using `console.log()` statements to test our code.

Then, explain the benefits of using automated tests like Jest tests to test our code.

### Response 3

## Question 4

Read this article on [semantic versioning](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semantic-versioning)

This question has two parts:

1. What is Semantic Versioning? Explain the differences between "major", "minor", and "patch" updates.
2. If our application is in version 1.6.4, and we're releasing a "minor" feature, what would our new version number be?

### Response 4

## Question 5

Imagine you are teaching a brand new programmer a brief lesson about functions. Your lesson should have the following components:
* A technical definition ("According to MDN, a function is...").
* An explanation of the concept with an analogy ("You can think of a function a ...")
* An example of the syntax for an arrow function using a JavaScript code block (triple backticks)
* An explanation of the syntax using the terms **arrow function**, **parameter**, **code block**, and **return statement**

Below, we've provided an outline for your response but feel free to modify it as you see fit.

### Response 5

Explanation of the concept with an analogy

Check out this example:

```js
// Add your example here
```

Explanation of the syntax.
